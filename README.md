# TIE - A 2D Tile Engine Prototype

This is a prototype of a 2D tile engine based on [JSIso](http://jsiso.com/), which both reduces the headaches of JSIso and adds useful features. Simple games can be created by supplying map files, complete with layers, height-maps, collision detection, path-finding, lighting, and extensible scripting.

## Example Game
At the current state, there is one example given in the [sample/](sample/) directory.


## Development
The engine is based on ES6 modules, so if that's your thing, import it directly!

You can also use [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org) to bundle it. Have a look at the [Webpack config file](webpack.config.js) or the official [Getting Started Guide](http://webpack.js.org/guides/get-started/) for how this works and install the dev-dependencies.

If you have suggestions or complaints, please open an issue on Github. If you would like to contribute, send a pull-request.
