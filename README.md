# TIE - A 2D Tile Engine Prototype

This is a prototype of a 2D tile engine based on [JSIso](http://jsiso.com/), which both reduces the headaches of JSIso and adds useful features. Simple games can be created by supplying map files, complete with layers, heightmaps, collision detection, pathfinding, lighting, and extendable scripting.

## Example Game

At the current state, there is one example given in [assets/maps/house.json](assets/maps/house.json). Serving this repository, [index.html](index.html) instantiates the engine and loads this sample level.

## Future

The structure of the repository and the engine itself have to be improved to enable better re-usability. It will stay a weekend project though ;-)
